# odin-recipes

This project is my first html project! I will be creating a webpage displaying different recipes. I hope to learn a lot.

*One project later*

Though it took me some time to finsih due to life complications, I can say that this was a good project to begin with. I learned a lot about using git throughout the project, using images, and using ordered and unordered lists.
It may not be the cleanest but it should be a good foundation for things to come. All recipes listed in the website have been taken from: allrecipes.com.
