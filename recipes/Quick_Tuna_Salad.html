            If you need the quickest of the quickest, this has to be my number one pick. With life becoming ever so busy, whipping up a big batch of this salad
            in one afternoon can feed you for an entire week. It will also have all the nutrients could ever need. You can have it for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, 
            even in the shower if you must.
